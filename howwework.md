# How We Work: Alluma Data Team Practices

## Daily Practices
We exist in different time zones, and need to consider availability and response with flexibility. Each day the team will do a stand-up virtually and in -person, initially we'll do these at 9:15AM PST for 15m max, or 5:15 London time. We'll cover what you worked on yesterday, what's up today, and blockers to progress.

## The Tools
Slack is our collab and chat tool. We'll do work there, but also keep it personal and friendly, investing time into each other as people, team mates. Pets and kids are fair game to share about.

Doc editing and reports get built in Office 365/OneDrive. Forms also live here.

Github is for projects, sans secure data projects

Trello is our task management tool.

Zoom/Webex calls are our meeting tools

## Security
Where possible, project work will be done on GitHub, however HIPAA is a thing, and some projects need to be in private repos or not here at all.
No PII or PHI can ever live on GitHub. Or on local machines, without following our security protocols.
