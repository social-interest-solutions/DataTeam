# Data Principles for Alluma

## How we approach data projects
1. Data is an asset, to Alluma, to the public agencies we support and to the communities we serve
2. We are stewards of the public's data, we do not own these dataset
3. Government data should be open and public wherever legally and ethically possible
4. Data can improve how we operate and how we serve our clients
5. Data holds the keys to better questions, it does not simply answer them
6. We never sell data
7. We make open all data that we legally, ethically can


## Operating Principles
1. Data collection and use policies should reflect respect for the rights of individuals and community groups.
2. Data users shall consider possible harms and all uses must eliminate harm to individuals and communities.
3. Data can indeed be biased. We consider the source, collection methods and systemic barriers that may introduce bias into our data and models.
4. Precautionary principle: Just because we can use data in a certain way, doesnâ€™t necessarily mean we should.
5. We establish checks and balances to account for unknown unknowns in our data.
6. PHI and PII are never to be disclosed to the public nor any unauthorized parties.
7. Our data science program will rely on https://ethicstoolkit.ai/ practices for all projects.
8. We will seek to achieve a balance between regulatory requirements for data retention and [Lean Data Practices](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/lean-data/).
