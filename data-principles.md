# Data Principles for Alluma

## How We Work
1.	Never be satisfied with the status quo. If the current state is inadequate, know that we have the ability to make it better. Civic Hacking 101* applies to nonprofits too.
2.	Say no to perfection and fail early and often. Do not make perfect the enemy of good. Use small experiments and learn from failures.
3.	Build others capacity to own our work. The Data Program does not need to be the sole home and expert on our work. We find owners and homes for our projects.
4.	No clunky, old IT. Use modern and lightweight tools. Design should be beautiful but also fun.
5.	Always center people and their stories. Our work must always connect to the people in the data, lifting up their stories is the best way to communicate our impact.
6.	Value humility over ego. We are never the smartest people in the room, we need to be constantly learning and listening to others.
7.	Inspire through problem solving. Build to address people’s pain points and needs by creating elegant designs that inspire people to want more. Empathy is more important than great code.
8.	Work in the open. We embrace an open culture, we open source what we can, write about our work, share frequently.
9.	Things unseen cannot be managed nor improved. Document our work obsessively, this goes for our assets too.
10.	Have fun, making the world a better place. We can acknowledge the seriousness of our field, while enjoying this work together, fun is always ok. Our work is hard and it matters, so we will celebrate small wins and recognize the struggle to make change happen.



## Ethical Principles
As data program inside a social enterprise nonprofit we have several aspects that differentiate us from other data teams. These values reflect the ways we must balance ethical and business and societal interests.
Our Beliefs:
1. We believe that data is an asset, to Alluma, to the public agencies we support and to the communities we serve. However, we are stewards of the public's data, we do not own these datasets (with the exception of metadata).
2. We believe government data should be open and public wherever legally and ethically possible and we will strive to encourage this and lead by example wherever possible.
3. We believe data can improve how we operate and how we serve our clients.
4. About the primacy of data; we believe that data holds the keys to better questions, it does not simply answer them
5. These data are not for sale.
6. We believe the precautionary principle applies to us: Just because we can use data in a certain way, doesn’t necessarily mean we should.
7. We make open all data that we legally, ethically can



## Privacy and Risk Principles
Because the data we will be managing and using are sensitive and/or regulated data, the Data Program will adhere to these standards of operation with respect to privacy and risk.  We seek to balance business needs and opportunities with the possible risks of data disclosure and publishing information which may potentially harm the communities we serve.
1. Data collection and use policies should reflect respect for the rights of individuals and community groups.
2. Data users shall consider possible harms and all uses must eliminate such harm to individuals and communities.
3. Data can indeed be biased. We consider the source, collection methods and systemic barriers that may introduce bias into our data and models.
5. We establish checks and balances to account for unknown unknowns in our data.
6. PHI and PII are never to be disclosed to the public nor any unauthorized parties.
7. Our data science program will rely on https://ethicstoolkit.ai/ practices for all projects.
8. We will seek to achieve a balance between regulatory requirements for data retention and [Lean Data Practices](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/lean-data/).
